        <h1> Hello world </h1>
        <P>Cloud computing[1] is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud
            storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user.[2] cloud computing is commonly
            known
            as
            delivery of computing services including servers, storage, databases, and intelligence over the Internet.The
            term is
            generally used to describe data centers available to many users over the Internet.[3] Large clouds,
            predominant
            today, often have functions distributed over multiple locations from central servers. If the connection to
            the
            user
            is relatively close, it may be designated an edge server.

            Clouds may be limited to a single organization (enterprise clouds[4][5]), or be available to multiple
            organizations
            (public cloud).

            Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale.

            Advocates of public and hybrid clouds note that cloud computing allows companies to avoid or minimize
            up-front
            IT
            infrastructure costs. Proponents also claim that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their
            applications up
            and
            running faster, with improved manageability and less maintenance, and that it enables IT teams to more
            rapidly
            adjust resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable demand,[5][6][7] providing the burst computing
            capability:
            high computing power at certain periods of peak demand.[8]
